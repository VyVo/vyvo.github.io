            In this circuit, I used 3 LEDs: red, yellow, and green. I chose them because they have the same voltage
                (which is 1.8V), and typically, we want to run them at 0.02A; as a result, I don't need to calculate 
                the resistances 3 times. I only need to calculate once and apply for all of them
                
                To find the resistance, I used Ohm's Law: Voltage(Volts) = Current(Amperes) x Resistance (Ohms)
                The voltage in this formula is the power of my laptop, which is 5V. 
                First, I need to find the voltage of the resistance: 
                V(total) = V(red LED) + V(resistance)
                <=> 5 = 1.8+ V(resistance)       => V(resistance) = 5-2.8 = 3.2V
                
                Apply it to the formula, V = I x R
                <=> 3.2 = 0.02 x R      => R(resistance) = 3.2/0.02 = 160 Ohms
                
                Because we don't have 160 Ohms resistance in the kit, so I used the 220 Ohms instead, and it's closest to 160!
