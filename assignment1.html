            In this circuit, I used 3 LEDs: red, yellow, and green. I chose them because they have the same voltage </br>
                (which is 1.8V), and typically, we want to run them at 0.02A; as a result, I don't need to calculate </br>
                the resistances 3 times. I only need to calculate once and apply for all of them</br>
                
                To find the resistance, I used Ohm's Law: Voltage(Volts) = Current(Amperes) x Resistance (Ohms) </br>
The voltage in this formula is the power of my laptop, which is 5V. </br>
First, I need to find the voltage of the resistance: </br>
V(total) = V(red LED) + V(resistance) </br>
<=> 5 = 1.8+ V(resistance)       => V(resistance) = 5-2.8 = 3.2V</br>
                
Apply it to the formula, V = I x R</br>
<=> 3.2 = 0.02 x R      => R(resistance) = 3.2/0.02 = 160 Ohms</br>
                
                Because we don't have 160 Ohms resistance in the kit, so I used the 220 Ohms instead, and it's closest to 160!</br>
