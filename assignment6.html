            <p>
                In this circuit, I used a joystick, which already has 2 inputs, and a red LED</br></br>
                To find the resistance of the LED, I used Ohm's Law: Voltage(Volts) = Current(Amperes) x Resistance (Ohms) </br></br>
The voltage in this formula is the power of my laptop, which is 5V. </br></br>
First, I need to find the voltage of the resistance: </br></br>
V(total) = V(red LED) + V(resistance) </br></br>
<=> 5 = 1.8+ V(resistance)       => V(resistance) = 5-2.8 = 3.2V</br></br>
                
Apply it to the formula, V = I x R</br></br>
<=> 3.2 = 0.02 x R      => R(resistance) = 3.2/0.02 = 160 Ohms</br></br>
                
                Because we don't have 160 Ohms resistance in the kit, so I used the 220 Ohms instead, and it's closest to 160!</br></br>
Also, the joystick has resistance too, but it's internal resistance so I wouldn't include here.
