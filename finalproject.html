            <h2> We’re HCDE; we design with other people in mind.</h2>
           
            <p>
                For the final project, I want to make something useful for people, so I decided to make a smart blind stick.</br>
                With this design, people don't need to buy a fancy blind stick, which is very expensive; they can attach this circuit into any stick they want.</br>
                A smart stick that helps people who are blind or visually impaired. It allows users to get to their destinations without colliding with obstacles.

<h3> Concept</h3>  
For my project, I want to create a smart blind stick. Whereas a regular blind stick allows the user to feel objects when the stick hits it, a smart blind stick will </br>
be able to detect whether there’s an object within a certain amount of range. When the smart blind stick detects an object in front of it, the red LED will light up and it’ll</br>
make a sound. This allows the user to know that there’s an obstacle in front of them and give them time to change directions.

  <h3> List of Materials</h3>  
Arduino</br>
Ultrasonic sensor</br>
9V battery and connector</br>
Active buzzer</br>
Red LED</br>
220V resistor</br>
Wires</br>
Tape</br>
A long stick</br>
    
    
</p>  
<p>
     To find the resistance of the LED, I used Ohm's Law: Voltage(Volts) = Current(Amperes) x Resistance (Ohms) </br>
The voltage in this formula is the power of my laptop, which is 5V. </br>
First, I need to find the voltage of the resistance: </br>
V(total) = V(red LED) + V(resistance) </br>
<=> 5 = 1.8+ V(resistance)       => V(resistance) = 5-2.8 = 3.2V</br>
                
Apply it to the formula, V = I x R</br>
<=> 3.2 = 0.02 x R      => R(resistance) = 3.2/0.02 = 160 Ohms</br></br>
                
                Because we don't have 160 Ohms resistance in the kit, so I used the 220 Ohms instead, and it's closest to 160!</br>
Also, the active buzzer has resistance too, but it's internal resistance so I wouldn't include here.
